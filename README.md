# TOTAL LAWYERS

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Designed By

- The design was provided by Internet Brands as part of a technical test for the position of a frontend developer.

## Important Notes

- The task is a 5 step multi-step form.
- Clicking on the "Next Step" button transitions the form to the next step.
- The design does not include a button to navigate back to previous steps on the form, so this implementation only navigates forward with no provision to navigate back to previous steps.

## Responsive Web Design Approach

While implementing this screen, I decided to take the "Mobile First" approach.
